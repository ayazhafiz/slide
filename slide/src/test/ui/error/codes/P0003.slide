All opening delimiters with closing pairs must have that closing delimiter as a
correctly-ordered complement in a slide program. In particular,

  - `(` and `)` are complements (parantheses)
  - `[` and `]` are complements (brackets)

The most obvious case for a mismatch is when an incorrect complement is used, for example in
`(1+2]` or `[1+2)`.

A complement to this is that nesting order must be obeyed. That is, `([1 + 2])` is valid but
`([1 + 2)]` is not.

Finally, a more subtle case may be when one set of delimiters is not properly closed, as in
the case

```text
([1 + 2)
       ^- expected closing `]`
```
