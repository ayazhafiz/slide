Tokens in a slide program must be mathematically significant. In particular, slide uses a
subset of canonical mathematical notation to represent expressions.

This error is fired on a token either because

  - The token is invalid in the language of common mathematical notation, and/or
  - The token is not yet supported by slide in representing expressions. In this case, we
    would appreciate a bug report at <https://github.com/yslide/slide/issues/new>.

NB: "canonical mathematical notation" is not well-defined. In general, slide's principle is
to use notation that is intuitive and obvious. Of course, reasonable people can disagree on
what this means.
