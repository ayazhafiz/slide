Patterns are illegal in a "regular" slide program; i.e. a program including a standard
expression.

In most cases, this error is fired because you intended to run an expression pattern through
slide, or wrote a variable in the form of a pattern.

Because patterns are abstractions over expressions, they cannot be evaluated in the way an
expression can without first being filled in by an expression. As an analogy, saying you
have "eaten groceries" does not provide concrete information about what you have eaten
without first defining what the groceries are.
