This error fires on tokens that are not connected to the rest of a primary statement in a
slide program.

For example, in the program

```text
1 + 2 3 + 4
      ^^^^^- offending tokens
```

`3 + 4` are not connected to the primary expression statement `1 + 2`, and slide does not
know how this is intended to be evaluated.

In the future, statement that are separated by a newline will not emit this error. The
following are examples of programs that currently emit this error, but in the future should not:

```text
a = 1
b = 2 - in the future, parsed as two assignment statements
```

```text
1 + 2
3 + 4 - in the future, parsed as two expression statements
```
