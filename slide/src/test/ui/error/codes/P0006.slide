All closing delimiters with opening pairs must have that opening delimiter as a complement in
a slide program. In particular,

  - `)` and `(` are complements (parantheses)
  - `]` and `[` are complements (brackets)

An unmatched closing delimiter error occurs when corresponding opening delimiters are not
present earlier in the slide program. Some examples include:

```text
1 + 2 )
      ^ unmatched closing delimiter
```

```text
1 + 2
)]
^ unmatched closing delimiter
 ^ unmatched closing delimiter
```
