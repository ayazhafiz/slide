~~~stdout
This error fires on token sequences that are expected to parse as an expression, but do not.

The following are examples of slide programs that emit this error:

```text
1 + +
    ^- offending token
```

```text
1 / )
    ^- offending token
```

```text
1 /
   ^- offending token: end of file
```

In all cases such programs are malformed and should be refactored to include complete
expressions.
