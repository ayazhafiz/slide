~~~stdout
This error is fired on variable definitions provided to a slide program that can never be
compatible. For example, given the program

```text
a := 1
a := 12 - 10
```

"a" is defined as "1" and "2" simultaneously, which are incompatible definitions.

This error is only fired when slide is able to statically detect incompatibility of
defintions. For example, without having information on what "c" is defined as, the program

```text
a := c
a := 2c
```

would not have an incompatible definitions error, because the program is valid when "c = 0".
However, if slide knew about that value of "c", as it would in the program

```text
a := c
a := 2c
c := 1
```

an incompatible definitions error could now be fired on the two definitions of "a".
