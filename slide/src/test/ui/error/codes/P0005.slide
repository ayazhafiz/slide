Variables are illegal in a slide expression pattern.

In most cases, this error is fired because you intended to evaluate an expression with
slide, or wrote a variable in place of a variable pattern.

Because expression patterns are meant to abstract over and match expressions, there is
generally not a need to explicitly define the name of a variable to be matched by an
expression pattern. Rather, the concern is generally with the shape of the variable; that
is, that it is actually a variable. For this use case, the "${name}" pattern (where "{name}"
is a text placeholder) serves as a variable-matching pattern.

As a concrete example, the expression pattern `$a + $b + $a` matches both the expressions
`a + b + a` and `b + a + b`. Both expressions are lowered the same way despite having
different variable names, so variable patterns permit abstraction and common representation
over the names.
