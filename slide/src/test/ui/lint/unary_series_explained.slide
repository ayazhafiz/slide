The unary series lint detects trivially-reducible chains of unary operators.

For example, the following chains of unary expressions can be reduced to a more trivial form:

```text
---1   -> -1
+++1   ->  1
+-+-+- -> -1
```

Chaining unary operators is not standard style in mathematical expressions and can be
misleading. For example, `--x` may be interpreted to be the prefix decrement operator available
in some computer programming languages, which is absent in canonical mathematical notation.
