~~~stdout
The similar names lint detects expression patterns with very similar names.

For example, the following pattern expression has different patterns with the same suffix "a":

```text
$a + #a + _a + $a
```

While this is expression is semantically valid, it can be difficuly to read and misleading,
since "a" is used in three separate and independent patterns. A clearer expression would be

```text
$a + #b + _c + $a
```
