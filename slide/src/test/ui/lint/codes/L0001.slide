The redundant nesting lint detects redundant nesting of expressions in parantheses or
brackets.

For example, the following nestings are redundant and can be reduced to a single nesting:

```text
((1))     -> (1)
[[1]]     -> [1]
([[(1)]]) -> (1)
```

Redundant nestings are difficult to read and may be misleading, as generally a single nesting
is expected to host an expression for precedence or clarity reasons.
