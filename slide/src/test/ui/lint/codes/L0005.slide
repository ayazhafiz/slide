This warning is fired on variable definitions that may be incompatible. For example, given
the program

```text
a := b
a := 2*b
```

The definitions of "a" are maybe-incompatible; in particular, they are compatible iff
"b := 0". This ambiguity is considered error-prone because it does not clearly communicate
intent of the definitions, and there is no information to validate the soundness of a program
in such a state.

The behavior of maybe-incompatible definitions is considered undefined behavior.
