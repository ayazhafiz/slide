The homogenous assignment lint detects and warns on mixed use of assignment operators.

For example, the following program uses both the equality and assign-define operators to
assign variables:

```text
a = 1
b := 1
```

This can be misleading or confusing, as these two operators are syntactically different (and
semantically different in canonical mathematics notation), but are treated the same in slide.

For this reason, it is suggested that exclusively `=` or `:=` are used for assignments in
slide programs.
